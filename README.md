# README: Flask Web App with Mesa Simulation

## Project Overview

This GitHub repository contains a Flask web application that integrates a Python Mesa simulation. The simulation provides a dynamic and interactive environment, while the Flask web app serves as the user interface. The front end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Mesa Simulation:** The core of the project is a simulation implemented using Mesa, a Python library for agent-based modeling. The simulation can be configured to model various scenarios, making it a powerful tool for studying complex systems.

- **Flask Web App:** The web application is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python. Flask is used to create the user interface and handle requests and responses between the client and the server.

- **Interactive User Interface:** The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components create an interactive and visually appealing user interface. Users can interact with the simulation, adjust parameters, and visualize the results in real-time.
